# Purpose

Graph databases are the future (imho)! This repository is just being used for some independant research on graph database abstractions.

## Contains

Currently I am in the process of getting everything working for `cypher`, and `graphql`. Tinkerpop's `gremlin` is a whole other beast as it is interpretted groovy.
